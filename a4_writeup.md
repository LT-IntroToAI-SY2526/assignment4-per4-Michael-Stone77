# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?

2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.

3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
How I would get the computer player to play the best move every time would be to make it learn from every game and be able to learn from it's mistakes and slowly over time be able to make better and better moves until it is able to make the best moves possible.  As it would play more games it would also learn from the player it was facing and grow it's proficiency until it knows how to play the game at an expert level and make the best move every time through all the experience it gains from the many games it will play.
