# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part of tic-tac-toe was writting that has won code as there were a lot of different ways a person could win tic tac toe and having to account for all of them without accidentally repeating one got confusing at times but it wasn't too bad.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would do it by programing a new function similar to make move but instead of it being entered by a person it would be entered by the computer.  It would do this by looking at the board and finding a place where there were no * and the other player hadn't made a move there. It would also look for the best spot to wither set up a victory or block the other player from winning.  With all this it should hopefully have created a computer player that could play the game well.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
How I would get the computer player to play the best move every time would be to make it learn from every game and be able to learn from it's mistakes and slowly over time be able to make better and better moves until it is able to make the best moves possible.  As it would play more games it would also learn from the player it was facing and grow it's proficiency until it knows how to play the game at an expert level and make the best move every time through all the experience it gains from the many games it will play.
